meta-openrc
================================

Introduction
-------------------------

This layer adds support for OpenRC to OpenEmbedded similarly to how rc.d
scripts and systemd are supported.  OpenRC can be selected by adding this
layer and adding `openrc` to `DISTRO_FEATURES`.

Both the standard rc.d scripts and those from OpenRC expect to live in
`/etc/init.d`.  When `openrc` is added to `DISTRO_FEATURES`, the former will be
removed from that directory entirely and only OpenRC capable scripts will be
installed [1].  If `openrc` is not added to `DISTRO_FEATURES` this layer will
not have any effect aside from providing the openrc recipe.


1.  This assumes that this layer has an append for the recipe in question.
